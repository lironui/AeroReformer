# **AeroReformer: Aerial Referring Transformer for UAV-Based Referring Image Segmentation**

🚀 **AeroReformer** is a novel **vision-language framework** for **UAV-based referring image segmentation (UAV-RIS)**, designed to address the unique challenges of aerial imagery, such as complex spatial scales, occlusions, and varying object orientations.  

Our approach integrates a **Vision-Language Cross-Attention Module (VLCAM)** for enhanced multimodal understanding and a **Rotation-Aware Multi-Scale Fusion (RAMSF) decoder** to improve segmentation accuracy in aerial scenes.
